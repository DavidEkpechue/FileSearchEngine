# FileSearchEngine
 App to search through files

This project is a search engine application designed to search through a collection of text files, autocorrect the entered search query using a built-in spell checker, and rank the files based on the frequency of the search term's occurrence.

## Core Functionality
Search Capability - Users can enter a search term, and the engine will find all occurrences across various files.
Autocorrection - Implements a spellchecker to suggest corrections to misspelled search terms before performing the search.
Ranking System - Files are ranked and displayed from the highest to the lowest frequency of the search term.
